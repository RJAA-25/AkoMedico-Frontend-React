Avion School Final Project

## Problem

The wealth of information about a person's medical history is usually stored and documented in single health facility. 
When a person goes to a different health facility to receive treatment, relevant details regarding the person is not transferred. 
A new record is created and the process of data-gathering is to be repeated. 

Imagine the same person going to multiple other health facilities.
The process becomes tedious and prone to false details as people tend to misremember information which may prove to be critical in times of health emergencies. 

## Solution

AkoMedico is a lifestyle app that makes access to personal health information easy. In short, a digital health passport!

Aside from the Personal Data Sheet information, you can also store:
- Attending physicians
- Emergency contacts
- Exisiting health conditions
- Consultations
- Admissions
- Medical abstracts, laboratory results, and prescriptions

## Goal

This project is the culmination of all the learnings about full-stack web development.
Communication between front-end (React) and back-end (Ruby on Rails) is facilitated and a third-party API is implemented in the application. 
The database which stores all user information is setup for production.
